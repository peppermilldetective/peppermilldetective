# About Me

Hi! I'm Jarrett! (aliases: PeppermillDetective or Sherlock)

I'm an aspiring Game Developer with a particular interest in Game Engine design and programming, and an enjoyment of all kinds of software development.

In my repositories, you'll find various attempts at learning and trying new technologies, most probably related to the Rust language. I usually seek to learn about things I have never learned about before, or relearn old things to refresh my own memory. Note that not everything I work on ends up on my github due to not feeling like creating a repository for it (usually because I follow a tutorial to play around with things), or because I had repositories that felt cluttered and decided to delete them to free up from clutter.

I currently enjoy programming in Rust and C# with occasional stints into C and C++. In the past, I have used Java, assembly (little bit of x86, some MIPS), Python, Ruby, SQL, Prolog, Racket, JavaScript (including jQuery, NPM, and React), HTML, CSS, Lua (currently learning for configuring Neovim), and others that I have probably forgotten to time.

# Interests

Programming, DnD, and games. I'm enjoying Rust as a language and trying to learn how to use Vulkan in it to make some simple graphics happen. 5E is great and Pathfinder is too easy to break IMO. Final Fantasy XIV, Monster Hunter Rise, and whatever else decides to eat my time are fun.

# How to Reach Me

Message me here on Github! I am not going to post any emails or discords to protect my privacy.
